# AeroStars UAV Telemetry and Navigation System

A lightweight, real-time telemetry and basic navigation system built using **Arduino Nano**, **NRF24L01**, **HC-05 Bluetooth**, and a custom **Android app**. Designed for fixed-wing or UAVs, this system enables in-flight monitoring of key flight metrics such as voltage, GPS location, signal strength, and more.

## 📲 Android App

A lightweight Android app was developed using **MIT App Inventor** to:

- Display telemetry (voltage, GPS, signal)
- Show status updates every second
- Receive data via HC-05 Bluetooth
- Log data for future analysis *(coming soon)*

📷 Screenshots and APK will be uploaded in `/android-app` folder.

## 🛠️ How to Use

### 📦 Upload TX Code to UAV Nano
- Sends GPS, voltage, and signal data over NRF24L01
- Add GPS on pins D3 (TX) and D4 (RX)
- Connect voltage divider to A0

### 🖥️ Upload RX Code to GCS Nano
- Receives and prints data via Serial
- Also forwards data over HC-05 to Bluetooth

### 📱 Connect to Android App
- Pair phone with **HC-05** (default PIN: `1234`)
- Open app → select HC-05 → view live data
